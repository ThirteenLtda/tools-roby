This section will present some of the more advanced Roby concepts. It assumes
that you have a good understanding of the basics of Roby, namely that you have
read the [concepts](concepts/index/) section and followed the
[tutorial](tutorial/index/).

It is a bit a list of things, but some of them will refer to others for a better
understanding. Have a look on the left menu for the different topics.

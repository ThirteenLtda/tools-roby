This section is a reference for the event relations. As you should already know
now, these relations are used to build the plans that are executed by Roby.

The objects representing each of these relations are stored in
Roby::EventStructure. New relations are defined with Roby::EventStructure.relation
(whose documentation is in {rdoc_class: RelationGraph}).

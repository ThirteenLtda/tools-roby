This section will present you the various ways one can interact with a Roby
application, or more exactly how to manipulate a Roby application from within
and from outside through [the action interface](../building/actions.html).

What we are going to cover in this section is:

 - how to use the actions from within your Roby application to handle startup
   sequences as well as a general system behaviour without human intervention
 - the tools that are available to start a Roby application and interact with
   it, including visualization tools

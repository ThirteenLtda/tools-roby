Let's look at the following situation. One creates a plan in which a MoveTo
task depends on an already running Localization task. In this plan, MoveTo is
not yet running while Localization already is. **Before** MoveTo gets started,
Localization fails.

Is that an error or not ?

In principle, not, as there is time to restart a new Localization task without
affecting the ability of MoveTo to achieve its goal. However, this assumes that
there is a high-level process that will exactly do that (which is not the case
by default in Roby).

This kind of "decisions", or policies, that need to be made during execution
are all centralized in a single component called the decision control component.
In Roby, this is a single class.

This class embeds all of Roby's default policies. It can be modified so as to
change the default behaviour on these cases where there is not a "one fits
all" rule.

Conclusion
----------
This finishes the explanation of Roby concepts. The rest of the documentation
will guide you through the Roby API so that you can start using it to control
your own systems ...

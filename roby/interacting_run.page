title: Running a Roby application
sort_info: 50
---

A Roby application gets started with

~~~
roby run -c
~~~

If a [specific robot configuration](../building/file_layout.html) needs to be
picked up, the common -rROBOT\[:ROBOT_TYPE] option can be given

~~~
roby -rrobot -c
~~~

The -c option tells Roby to load a _controller file_. This file has to be named
as the robot (therefore -c is meaningless without a robot name) and stored in
scripts/controllers/ (e.g. scripts/controllers/myrobot.rb). The controller file
is meant as a way to define a "full application", i.e. a predefined startup and
reaction system that is "the" overall behaviour of the robot. Running the
application without -c is usually meant for debugging.

Additionally, actions can be specified on the command line (as they would be
given on Roby shell's command line, see the next page). They get started
automatically. You probably will have to quote the actions, as the exclamation
mark is often a reserved character.

roby run -rmyrobot 'move!(:target => [10, 0, 0])'

module Roby
    # This event generator combines a source and a limit in a temporal pattern.
    # The generator acts as a pass-through for the source, until the limit is
    # itself emitted. It means that:
    #
    # * before the limit is emitted, the generator will emit each time its
    #  source emits 
    # * since the point where the limit is emitted, the generator
    #   does not emit anymore
    #
    # See also EventGenerator#until

        # generators

		source.forward_to(self)
		limit.signals(self)

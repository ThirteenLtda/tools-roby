So far, we have seen that the plan is basically a bunch of tasks and events that
are related to each other.

What this page will detail is how Roby knows what is needed by the system and
what is not. And what it does with the garbage ...

Missions and permanent tasks
----------------------------
In any Roby plan, a certain (usually limited) number of tasks are marked either as
__missions__ or as __permanent__ tasks. The missions are the current robot's
main activities (i.e. what it should do). The permanent tasks are the tasks that
the system's controller wants to keep around, but which are not essential to its
function. This marking is done manually, usually when the system is given a
high-level command

The main effect of this marking is

Garbage collection

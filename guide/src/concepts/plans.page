Now that we have seen what the [reactor pattern](reactor.html) is about, we will
dig a bit more into how things are managed inside Roby.

The main issue with reactor frameworks in general is their inability to offer a
high-level structure. Events are the only things that you deal with. This
becomes tedious when errors happen, as tracking down what happened is very hard.

In contrast, Roby tries very hard to provide a structure to what happens to the
system. This page will describe how this is done

The basic object is the __event__. Events are, obviously, a representation of
what happens to the system. As we will see later, it is also a way to represent
which commands can be sent to it.
* *events*. They are both the basic command interface and the way to follow what
  happens in and outside of the robot.
* *tasks*. They represent the multiple processes that run on the robot: both the
  robot physical actions and the robot's internal processing.

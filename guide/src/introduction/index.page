= What is Roby ?

Roby is a plan manager: it allows to represent, execute and adapt a plan, which
is a representation of the past, present and future activities of a robot along
with the information needed to verify that their executin is going well, and to
manage errors.

Roby is:
* a task/event model in which one can represent the activities (Roby::Task) and
  the noticeable situations during execution (Roby::EventGenerator,
  Roby::Task.event).
* a set of task relations describing the interactions between the activities
  (Roby::TaskStructure).
* a set of event relations describing the reaction the system should have in
  response to some situations (Roby::EventStructure).
* error management tools which allow to catch errors during execution and
  repair them (i.e. let the system manage the error).
* a mean to modify the plan as it is being executed (Roby::Transaction)
* (G)UI tools for interacting/controlling the living system.
* all of that in a multi-robot context.

Roby is the result of my PhD. As such, my PhD thesis can be considered as a
design document for the system. If you want an overview of the principles, you
can also refer to the publications I did.

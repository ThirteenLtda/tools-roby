Now that we saw [the basics](../basics/index.html), this section will present in
greater details how execution works in Roby. First, we will see how a Roby
application is structured, how it is initialized and when the execution engine,
that executes Roby plans, starts to kick in. We will present, in turn, each of
the three phases that make the event propagation cycle (see figure below).

* a high-level overview of how event propagation works. In there, you will
  learn that the #emit and #call method calls are handled specially during
  event propagation, and why it is so.
* a list of the features of event propagation that are useful to you, developper
  of Roby applications.
* a quick overview of the error handling phase
* the garbage collection phase, why it exists and how it should affect your
  way to build plans in Roby.

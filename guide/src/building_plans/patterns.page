Ideally, when writing tasks, one should seek to write it in a way that has as
as little assumptions as possible about the tasks that are around it. It can
obviously require some functionalities / interfaces from them. But it should
not assume, say, that "localization_child is a task of type X".

Moreover, a good guideline when building plans is to avoid having a given task
access other tasks that are at a distance of more than 1 in any given relation.
I.e. a task should only access other tasks that are in its direct neighborhood.

The most useful tool to achieve this is the forwarding relation: it allows to
"forward" an event between tasks, making the child event an equivalent of the
parent event.

For instance:

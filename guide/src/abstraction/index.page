Being able to abstract away the little details of execution is crucial. Indeed,
it allows to apply high-level reasoning algorithms, that are not able to take
into account too much details.

Roby offers a unique ability: to link in the same plan the high-level parts of
the plan and the low-level ones. What this section will present is how, using
Roby's plan model, one can represent the _mechanism_ of abstraction. In other
words, what are the details that are lost in the abstraction mechanism.

More specifically, we will see the following:

* the object-oriented nature of Roby's plan model: how task models are related
  to each other, and the notion of abstract models.
* how the hierarchy relation uses this OO principles to not over-constrain the
  plan. We will see that the hierarchy relation can be used to precisely
  represent what is _needed_ and not only what _is_.
* how the execution flow of the low-level parts of the plan can be linked to the
  higher-level execution flow by means of the _forwarding_ relation.
* how it is possible to cleanly (and easily) build event commands using tasks

To understand the content of this section, we will assume that you read and
understood the [basics](../basics/index.html).
